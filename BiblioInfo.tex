\abstracttext{Computers are becoming pervasive in our society through the use of tablets, smartphones, computers embedded in home appliances and televisions. These devices are becoming more connected, creating an Internet of Things. The Internet of Things will make use of all collected data now stored separately in devices and allow for a new type of immersive applications by utilizing userdata from several sources. 
MediaSense as an Internet of Things middleware allows for communication between devices and the distributed sharing of context information. MediaSense in its current form it is not 
geared towards the smaller, portable computers that are making up the Internet of Things. This project applies a design science methodology for re-enginering the platform to make it usable on ubiquitous devices. The proposed redesign intended to make a shared background service, a so called daemon, of the MediaSense platform so functionality of sharing and storing sensor data is shared among the applications using it. To implement this behavior a type of inter-process communication had to be chosen to allow the applications to communicate with the platform. The Java implementation of Remote Procedure Call, called Remote Method Invocation was chosen. The new version of MediaSense was designed and developed according to the requirements outlined by the lead developer of MediaSense. The redesign resulted in lower memory usage and less CPU time. 
This discovery will make Internet of Things middleware possible to use every day and everywhere.}
