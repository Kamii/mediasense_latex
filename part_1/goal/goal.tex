\section{Goal}
By improving the resource usage of distributed Internet of Things middlewares, they will become usable on ubiquitous devices. Allowing several applications to share necessary resources can reduce the resource overhead. 

The goal of this project is to re-engineer, MediaSense, a distributed middleware, so that it requires fewer resources, thus making it capable to run multiple applications on ubiquitous devices.
