\section{Problem}
Distributed Internet of Things middlewares are designed for resource capable devices such as desktop computers and servers. One of the main requirements for Internet of Things middleware defined by Theo Kanter et al. \cite{Kanter539187} is to have a lightweight middleware. Since the sale of smartphones surpassed that of computers and laptops in 2011 [reffy] the Internet of Things will heavily incorporate more ubiquitous devices with lower resource availability that can be mass deployed. The current design of distributed Internet of Things middleware excludes usage of such ubiquitous devices.
