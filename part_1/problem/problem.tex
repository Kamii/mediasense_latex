\section{Problem}
The Internet of Things aim to enable massive immersive applications. Since the sale of smartphones surpassed that of computers and laptops in 2011 \cite{canalsys} the Internet of Things will heavily incorporate more ubiquitous devices with lower resource availability that can be mass deployed. Therefore, these applications must be able to run on ubiquitous devices.

Distributed Internet of Things middlewares are designed for resource capable devices such as desktop computers and servers. One of the main requirements for Internet of Things middleware defined by Theo Kanter et al. \cite{Kanter539187} is to have a lightweight middleware. The current design of distributed Internet of Things middleware excludes usage of such ubiquitous devices.

By improving the resource usage of distributed Internet of Things middlewares they will become usable on ubiquitous devices.
