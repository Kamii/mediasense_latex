\section{Scope}
The work undertaken during this project is restricted to the MediaSense platform as it is a distributed context-aware platform for the internet of things. MediaSense is written in the Java programming language and our choice of tools to achieve our goals will be based on Java. We will extend the MediaSense platform to support applications written in Java and will only support personal computers and not any mobile platforms like iOS or Android.
