\section{Scope}
MediaSense is written in the Java programming language and our choice of tools to achieve our goals will be based on Java. We will extend the MediaSense platform to support applications written in Java and evaluate it and ensure it will be able to run on a device with constrained resources. No cross platform support will be added and mobile platforms like iOS or Android will not be tested.
