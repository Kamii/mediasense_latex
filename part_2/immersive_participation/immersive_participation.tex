\section{Immersive Participation}
Immersive Participation is focused on interaction on the Internet using context-awareness to enable people, places and things to be connected to each other and participate in a virtual world. Common examples of Immersive Participation include Google Ingress \cite{ingress}, where users join teams and compete with other teams in a virtual world, TURF \cite{turf} where users capture real world places and gain points and RATS Theatre's \cite{rats} application called Maryam \cite{maryam} which are an interactive theater where audio clips is triggered depending on the user's GPS position.

Larger scale immersive applications will benefit from scalable distributed information sharing and also remove bottlenecks and dependencies on centralized web portals on the internet.
The way humans interact with each other and things around them will respond to new sensor information creating immersive environments that blend the natural world with a seamless Internet of Things.
