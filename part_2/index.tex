\chapter{Background And Theory}
This chapter explores the two general areas of Computer Science that are considered when developing and deploying an Internet of Things platform supporting resource constrained devices. Firstly, we describe the general area of Immersive Participation and its constituent theories around pervasive computing. Secondly we look at the deployment of pervasive middleware in the distributed computing paradigm more closely examining the MediaSense platform as a concrete realisation of this approach. Additionally, we discuss the general trend of pervasive and ubiquitous computing towards resource constraint devices. Finally we look at the inter procedure communication and more specifically remote method invocation as the theory for extending the MediaSense platform in order to solve the problem shown in section \ref{problem}.
