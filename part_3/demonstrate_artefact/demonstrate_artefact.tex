\section{Research Method For Demonstrate Artefact}
A demonstration of the artefact will be done for the stakeholder based on a use case scenario. Because the artefact is a distributed system intended to be used on a large scale and as the artefact still is a research project and the applications intended to be used with it have not been constructed, a real life case cannot be constructed for the demonstration. The scenario will be enacted with a test application and on a smaller scale. The aim of the demonstration will be to cover all requirements and demonstrate that all goals have been met.
