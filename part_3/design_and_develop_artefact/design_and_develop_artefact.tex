\section{Design and Develop Artefact}
With the information gathered in the earlier stages of the design science process architectural changes will need to be designed. For this process participative modelling \cite{johannesson2012design} and document study will be used. The participative modelling will mainly be done by drawing architectural models on a whiteboard and the document studies will be done to research similar solutions and usable technologies. 

The development of the design will be done with pair programming \cite{williams2000all} which is a practice from the software development methodology extreme programming. According to  \cite{williams2000all} two programmers working together will find twice as many solutions to a problem compared to working alone. Also bugs will be found in an earlier state and this will give higher quality on the artefact. To keep the timeline and give updates to the lead developer of MediaSense weekly meetings was arranged where the progress of designing and developing the artefact was presented.
