\section{Ethical Considerations}
All information uncovered in the interviews will be used confidentially, and we will assure the respondent consensually agree to have all answers published in this thesis.
The MediaSense platform uses the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 \cite{gnu}, and as such, there is no confidentiality we need to observe regarding the source code of it.
All test environments used for testing the distributed Internet of Things middleware will be run on a local sandbox for development so the nodes in the network will only contain our own computers.
