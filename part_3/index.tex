\chapter{Method}
To be able to solve the problem it is necessary to rethink and redesign core-components of the an existing middleware. Using traditional quantitative or qualitative research methods would not involve any actual designing. These research methods produce data based on past or present conditions and don't allow researchers to develop artefacts.
Design science research differs in one major way from qualitative or quantitative empirical studies. Where empirical studies focus on finding patterns in the past or present of an industry or a field, design science is intended to design and develop new solutions to actual problems \cite{bider2012design} and aims to improve and create artefacts that can improve the world \cite{johannesson2012design}. 
Design science is well suited for this problem because it involves a step where requirements are identified and a design and develop action where the researchers develop an artefact based on the requirements. Lastly there is an evaluation action where the artefact is evaluated based on the requirements to see if they have been met and thus if the artefact solved the problem. Consequently design science is a good method to use for this problem where a redesign of an existing middleware for the Internet of Things is needed.

The method chosen for this research is design science as defined by Johannesson and Perjons in A Design science primer \cite{johannesson2012design}. It is well structured and has guidelines that makes it easy to use as opposed to other definitions of design science such as the one laid out in Memorandum on design-oriented information systems research \cite{osterle2010memorandum} or the one mentioned in Design science in information systems research \cite{hevner2004design}. Johannesson and Perjons mention that Design Science consists of 5 actions, as shown in figure \ref{ds}. This actions not proposed to be used in a sequence, the steps should be used in an iterative way. In design science it is possible to use other methods to answer questions about artefact. Every action in Figure \ref{ds} should have its own methodology or it can even have several methodologies. MediaSense is still a research project and real life use cases would require applications and therefore the demonstration action will not be performed as it's not valuable to this research.
