\chapter{Methodology}
To be able to re-engineer MediaSense it is necessary to rethink and re-design core-components of the existing middleware. Using traditional quantitative or qualitative research methods would not involve any actual design. These research methods produce data based on past or present conditions and are usually not used to develop artefacts.
Design science research differs in one major way from qualitative or quantitative empirical studies. Where empirical studies focus on finding patterns in the past or present state of an industry or a field, design science is intended to design and develop new solutions to actual problems \cite{bider2012design} and aims to improve and create artefacts that can improve the world \cite{johannesson2012design}. Because the re-engineering MediaSense means re-designing an artefact design science reasearch is pertinent for the task.
Design science consists of a few steps, or actions. The first action is to explicate the problem, the second is identifying requirements and the third is a design and develop action where an artefact is constructed based on the requirements previously identifyed. An optional demonstration action can be applied to show the artefact in a real life scenario. Lastly there is an evaluation action where the artefact is evaluated based on the requirements to see if they have been met and thus if the artefact solved the problem. Consequently design science is a good method to use for this problem where a redesign of an existing middleware for the Internet of Things is needed.

The method chosen for this research is design science as defined by Johannesson and Perjons in A Design science primer \cite{johannesson2012design}. It is well structured and has guidelines that makes it easy to use as opposed to other definitions of design science such as the one laid out in Memorandum on design-oriented information systems research \cite{osterle2010memorandum} or the one mentioned in Design science in information systems research \cite{hevner2004design}. Johannesson and Perjons mention that Design Science consists of 5 actions, as shown in figure \ref{ds}. These actions are carried out iteratively instead of sequentially because later actions can yeild information necessary to previous actions, i.e., the design and develop action reveals new requirements for the artefact. In design science it is possible to use other methods to answer questions about artefact. Every action in Figure \ref{ds} should have its own research strategy and methods. For this thesis the demonstration action will be omitted. MediaSense is still a research project and real life use-cases for the demonstration would require actual applications. The evaluation action will include tests with test applications that sufficiently demonstrate that the problem has been solved.

The following sections present how the research method for each of the activities of the design science method was chosen and implemented. The last section discusses the ethical issues with respect to this research.
