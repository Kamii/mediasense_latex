\chapter{Explicate Problem}
This step in Design Science \cite{johannesson2012design} is to formulate precisely the initial problem and investigate its underlying causes. To define the problem as precisely as possible a scenario will be defined. The problem was split into several sub-problems. As mentioned before the research method for explicating the problem is a document study of previous publications regarding distributed Internet of Things middleware, document study of reading the source code for MediaSense and interviews of a stakeholder with knowledge about MediaSense and the concept Internet of Things.
