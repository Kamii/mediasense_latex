%\section{Outline Artefact}
To solve the problem a new type of Internet of Things middleware is required to be developed. Instead of developing a completely new middleware an existing one was chosen to be redesigned. The analysis of the problem explication uncovered that the main cause for the resource overhead in MediaSense is the distributed approach of the network layer. This is because every application has its own middleware and the middleware has its own server and client to communicate with other nodes. A redesign is necessary to build a middleware with one common instance of a middleware for every application. The new artefact is a fork of the existing middleware MediaSense. In \cite{johannesson2012design} four types of artefact is defined: \emph{constructs}, \emph{models}, \emph{methods} and \emph{instantiations}.  

\begin{quotation}
  \textbf{Constructs} are terms, notations, definitions, and concepts that are needed for formulating problems and their possible solutions.
  \textbf{Models} are used to depict or represent other objects.
  \textbf{Methods} express prescriptive knowledge by defining guidelines and processes for how to solve problems and achieve goals.
  \textbf{Instantiations} are working systems that can be used in a practice.
\end{quotation}
The artefact type will therefore be an instantiation.
